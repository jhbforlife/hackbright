Practice and experiment with React Native’s core components and style props by building the UI for a simple calculator app.

## Overview

Notice that a simple calculator doesn’t seem to have a ton of features. It only has basic arithmetic operations and no memory or other advanced functions. This is intentional. You already have a bunch of React experience (working with state, props, and handling events) — in this lab, we want you to focus on getting hands-on with React Native-specific skills.

### What You’ll Build

You’ll build a static version of a simple calculator app based on the mockup above. You should spend most of your time on layout and styling. At the end, your calculator should look nothing like the mockup above — it should be busy and maybe even a little ugly. Think [hyperpop aesthics](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperpop) over crisp, minimal design. Remember, the point is to get comfortable with React Native’s layout and style props.

Here are some ideas to try out:

- Change the shape of the buttons. Maybe they’re circles instead of squares. Maybe they’re all different shapes and sizes
- Add gradients or background images
- Play with changing styles when the user long-presses a button
- Use different fonts for the buttons and the display area
- For inspiration: browse the reference docs for [View Style Props](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view-style-props), [Text Style Props](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text-style-props), and [Shadow Props](https://reactnative.dev/docs/shadow-props)

## Finished?

Share screenshots of your calculator with the cohort!

If you have time, you can also work on adding basic functionality and interactivity to the calculator.
